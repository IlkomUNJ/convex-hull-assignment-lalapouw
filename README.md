# AI usage
I asked AI "can you make a code in qt creator to create a canvas that allows drawing points" to create a canvas in Qt that allows drawing points. I also used the AI to provide step-by-step explanations of the algorithms so I could better understand how they work. I used ChatGPT to help this homework. I asked “explain the iteration algorithm” to understand how iteration counting works inside convex hull. 

# Collaboration usage
I used help from my friends to complete this assignment. From them, I got additional ideas for the algorithms and task details, such as the need to implement both the slow convex hull and the fast convex hull (Citra and Cintia). They also helped me think about how to adapt and structure the solution, so I didn’t just copy but actually learned how to apply the ideas into my own project. And also, when I got an error whether it was caused by the application or by the code, my friends helped me troubleshoot and fix the problem.
